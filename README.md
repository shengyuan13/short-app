# URL shortener algorithm used
    The method used to solve this challenge was converting the short_urls table 'id' field which is in decimals(base-10) into base-62.
    The reason we are using base-62 is because if we take into account all the numbers from 0 to 9 and all lower/upper case alphabets, we get 62 characters.

        CHARACTERS = [*'0'..'9', *'a'..'z', *'A'..'Z']    # 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  -> this is equal to 62 characters

    Since base 62 is not supported by 'to_s' method, we needed to implement it ourself
    
    
    The algorithm was implemented using the following steps:

    1. Instantiate a global variable 'CHARACTERS' = [*'0'..'9', *'a'..'z', *'A'..'Z'] that contains a list with all the numbers from 0 to 9 and all the uppercase/lowercase characters of the alphabet.
    2. Instantiate a empty string variable 'short'
    3. Instantiate a 'id' variable with the created DB record id value (generated by MySQL)
    4.
        while our 'id' is greater than 0
            concat the value of the array 'CHARACTERS' at the position (id modulo 62)
            set the value of 'id' to the division of 'id' into 62 ('id' / 62)
    5. Reverse our the value of or 'short' string.


    Examples:
         base-10   |  base-62
            61           Z
            1            1
            9            9
            10           a
